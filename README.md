# StructMatTool
A tool for structural and material analysis and calculations. 

# What does this project do ?
This project is mostly for my own exploration and interest - it aims to synthesize common equations and information used in structural engineering to accomplish various calculations and analyses of structural and material performance, mostly in the context of aerospace engineering.

# Why is this project useful ?
From my experience, even basic structural and material engineering analyses and calculations can require lots of research and computation. With this tool, I'd like to create a more detailed and specific database of materials and their properties used in aerospace engineering, as well as develop a tool that can complete various calculations in the context of structural engineering.
